## 📖 What is codexray?

codexray gives you a clear view of your software projects. It helps you understand the structure and details of your code without needing to be a programmer. The app builds a knowledge graph — a map of how your code parts connect. It also runs several tools to spot problems and improve your work.

Key things codexray does:

- Finds links between files and functions
- Shows which parts of your project are used or unused
- Helps analyze the impact before making changes
- Speeds up searches with smart technology
- Supports popular tools that help AI coding assistants save data

You don’t have to write code. codexray’s visual and data tools make your work clearer and simpler.

## 💻 Who can use codexray?

This app is designed for:

- Developers wanting a better overview of their code
- Project managers who need to check progress without diving into code
- Tech support teams tracking down bugs faster
- Students and learners exploring code projects
- Anyone curious about how their software works under the hood

You only need a computer and an interest in understanding software better. No coding skills required.

## 🛠️ How codexray works

codexray uses modern code analysis methods. It reads the code files and builds a semantic knowledge graph. This graph captures the meaning and connections in the project rather than just text.

The app runs 16 different tools to help spot issues or offer insights, such as:

- **TF-IDF Search:** Finds relevant pieces of code quickly using smart keyword matching.
- **Call Graphs:** Maps function calls to show how parts relate.
- **Impact Analysis:** Predicts the effect of changes in your code.
- **Dead Code Detection:** Identifies unused or obsolete code that can be removed.

codexray works well with the latest AI code tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf, helping save time and data during development.
